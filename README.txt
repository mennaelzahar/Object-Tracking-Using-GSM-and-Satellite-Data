This project was implemented as the final milestone for the embedded systems course in Spring 2022. 
It is an embedded localization system that can be attached to any device for tracking purposes using Satellite data for getting the device's location, and a GSM module to send the location data to the cloud (ThingSpeak) to visualize it.
To open this project, you need to install STM32CubeMX.
